## **Use Cases**
The AWS VPN setup can be utilized in various scenarios, including:

1. **Remote Access (Bastion Alternative)**: Provide a secure alternative to a bastion by enabling authorized users to securely connect with high availability to AWS resources through a virtual private network (VPN) from remote locations.

2. **Site-to-Site Connectivity**: Establish secure connections between multiple on-premises data centers or branch offices and the AWS cloud, enabling seamless and protected communication between these environments, including multi-region deployments.

3. **Third-Party Vendor Access**: Many enterprises work with external vendors or consultants who require access to specific resources for collaboration or system integration. Cloud network security plays a vital role in this scenario. This VPN can provide a secure and controlled connection for these vendors to access the necessary resources without exposing the internal network to external threats.
