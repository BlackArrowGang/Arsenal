## **Why Choose ARM64?**

- **Cost Optimization:** ARM64-based instances offer cost savings compared to x86-based instances due to their power-efficient design, reducing energy consumption and infrastructure costs.💰✅

- **Performance:** ARM64 processors, like Graviton, can deliver excellent performance for certain types of workloads. They are particularly well-suited for scale-out applications, such as web servers, containerized microservices, and caching fleets.⚡️💪🏼s

## **How does it differ from x86 architecture?**

## **Use Cases**

1. 

2. **Scale-out Workloads:** ARM64 instances excel in scale-out workloads, where you distribute the workload across multiple instances. Web servers, microservices, and containerized applications are examples of workloads that can benefit from ARM64's ability to efficiently handle parallel processing and high traffic volumes.

3. **Third-Party Vendor Access**: 

## **Requirements**
