## **Use Cases**
The AWS VPN setup can be utilized in various scenarios, including:

1. **Remote Access (Bastion Alternative)**: Provide a secure alternative to a bastion by enabling authorized users to securely connect with high availability to AWS resources through a virtual private network (VPN) from remote locations.

2. **Site-to-Site Connectivity**: Establish secure connections between multiple on-premises data centers or branch offices and the AWS cloud, enabling seamless and protected communication between these environments, including multi-region deployments.

3. **Third-Party Vendor Access**: Many enterprises work with external vendors or consultants who require access to specific resources for collaboration or system integration. Cloud network security plays a vital role in this scenario. This VPN can provide a secure and controlled connection for these vendors to access the necessary resources without exposing the internal network to external threats.

## **Requirements**
| Name     | Version  |
|----------|----------|
|[terraform](#requirement\_terraform) | >= 1.0 |
|[aws-cli](#requirement\_terraform)   | >= 2.0 |
|[OpenVPN Client](#requirement\_terraform)   | >= 2.5 |

## **Installation**
Install a OpenVPN client
   - Desktop version
      - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download/" target="_blank">AWS Desktop client</a>
   - linux (Debian)
      ```
      sudo apt install openvpn
      ```

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/BlackArrowGang/Arsenal.git
```
Go to the solution directory
```
cd /Arsenal/quiver/aws-vpn-client
```
Install terraform modules
```
terraform init
```

## **Usage**

To use this code, follow these steps:

**Terraform Setup**
   1. Open a terminal window.
   2. Run the following commands.

```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply
```
**Connect to VPN**
   1. Refer to this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/mutual.html" target="_blank">AWS</a>
  documentation for detailed instructions on setting up the vpn certificates on your account.
   2. Then go to the section named "Exporting and configuring the VPN client configuration file" of this other <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/accessing-an-amazon-rds-instance-remotely-using-aws-client-vpn/" target="_blank">AWS</a> documentation to connect with your vpn client.
  
## **How It Works**
1. Provider Configuration:
   - Configures the AWS provider with your default credentials and desired region.

2. Security Group Modules:
   - Creates security group modules with specific configurations:
     - "security_group" allows inbound UDP traffic on port 443 from all IP ranges.
     - "security_group_networks" allows all traffic between networks within the VPC and outbound TCP traffic on the desired port to itself.

3. Client VPN Configuration:
   - Configures an EC2 client VPN:
     - Sets up an authorization rule for VPN access to the entire VPC or a specific CIDR block.
     - Creates a client VPN endpoint with server and client certificates, a client CIDR block, and split tunneling enabled.
     - Associates security groups with the client VPN endpoint.
     - Configures certificate-based authentication.

4. VPC Module:
   - Creates a custom VPC with the CIDR block across two availability zones.
   - Includes two private subnets.
