# **Provision AWS Lambda with Terraform: Harness the Power of Docker Containers**

## **Description**
Simplify the deployment of Docker containers as Lambda functions on AWS using Terraform. This code snippet creates a Lambda function module, and effortlessly deploys a container image. Customize the function name, description, and provide the private ECR image URI for a seamless deployment experience. Streamline your AWS Lambda deployment process and unleash the power of containerization with this efficient Terraform solution.

## **Use Cases**
1. **Serverless Microservices:** Deploying Docker containers as Lambda functions with Terraform enables you to build serverless microservices architectures. Each containerized Lambda function can encapsulate a specific functionality or service, allowing for independent scaling, easy management, and efficient resource utilization.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines:** By leveraging Terraform to deploy Docker containers on AWS Lambda, you can integrate this process into your CI/CD pipelines. Automate the deployment of containerized applications as Lambda functions, ensuring consistent and reliable deployment across multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production.

3. **Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs:** Terraform enables you to schedule Docker container execution as Lambda functions, making it ideal for automating routine tasks, cron jobs, and scheduled processes. Whether it's data backups, periodic data processing, or system maintenance, you can leverage Lambda's built-in scheduling capabilities to execute containerized tasks at specific intervals.
